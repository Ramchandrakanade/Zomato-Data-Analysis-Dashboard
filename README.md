# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Zomato restaurant dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant types, and ratings across various dining categories.

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g. handling missing values, parsing ratings)
- Exploratory visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Aggregated analysis of:
  - Restaurant types (`listed_in(type)`)
  - Customer votes and ratings
- Key insights drawn from visual trends

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Insights

- Majority of customers prefer **dining** category restaurants.
- Voting patterns and ratings help identify popular restaurant types.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses a CSV dataset titled `"Zomato data .csv"` (assumed to be available locally in the same directory as the notebook).
